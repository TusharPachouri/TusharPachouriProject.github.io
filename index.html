    <h3>1. First Come First Serve Scheduling:</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      The full form of FCFS Scheduling is First Come First Serve Scheduling.
      FCFS Scheduling algorithm automatically executes the queued processes and
      requests in the order of their arrival. It allocates the job that first
      arrived in the queue to the CPU, then allocates the second one, and so on.
      FCFS is the simplest and easiest CPU scheduling algorithm, managed with a
      FIFO queue. FIFO stands for First In First Out. The FCFS scheduling
      algorithm places the arriving processes/jobs at the very end of the queue.
      So, the processes that request the CPU first get the allocation from the
      CPU first. As any process enters the FIFO queue, its Process Control Block
      (PCB) gets linked with the queueâ€™s tail. As the CPU becomes free, the
      process at the very beginning gets assigned to it. Even if the CPU starts
      working on a longer job, many shorter ones have to wait after it. The FCFS
      scheduling algorithm works in most of the batches of operating systems.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>2. Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling:</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      Till now, we were scheduling the processes according to their arrival time
      (in FCFS scheduling). However, SJF scheduling algorithm, schedules the
      processes according to their burst time. In SJF scheduling, the process
      with the lowest burst time, among the list of available processes in the
      ready queue, is going to be scheduled next. However, it is very difficult
      to predict the burst time needed for a process hence this algorithm is
      very difficult to implement in the system.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>3. Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm:</h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      Round Robin scheduling algorithm is one of the most popular scheduling
      algorithm which can actually be implemented in most of the operating
      systems. This is the preemptive version of first come first serve
      scheduling. The Algorithm focuses on Time Sharing. In this algorithm,
      every process gets executed in a cyclic way. A certain time slice is
      defined in the system which is called time quantum. Each process present
      in the ready queue is assigned the CPU for that time quantum, if the
      execution of the process is completed during that time then the process
      will terminate else the process will go back to the ready queue and waits
      for the next turn to complete the execution.
